# AI-Lab-project
This repository hosts a project focused on deciphering the cellular reactions to hypoxia, a state of insufficient oxygen, especially in the field of oncology. Entirely implemented in Python, we utilize a classification methodology based on gene activity to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, classifying and comprehending cells under various oxygen conditions. Our primary goal is to distinguish between normoxic and hypoxic cells, thereby enhancing our grasp of the physiological and pathological events linked with these states. Additionally, this project emphasizes feature selection, intending to identify the most critical determinants for precise cell categorization and predictive modelling within this specific scope.
