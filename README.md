Artificial Intelligence project June 2023, This project presents a gene-activity-based classification approach for deciphering cellular responses to hypoxia in scRNA-seq data. It aims to identify cells in varying oxygenation states, distinguish between normoxic and hypoxic states, and highlights key features for accurate cell classification.
